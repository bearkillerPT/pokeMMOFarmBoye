This is a tool for pokeMMO automated farm! Built with fun in mind :))

# PokeGame
This class has many utility functions for manipulating the game's input!

# FarmBoye
Defined in farm.py this is the actual bot. The objectives are easy to set (search for abra_text).
It's finally up! Star the repo and follow me because I've some commitment to this project!

## Current State
Currently the bot knows only how to farm abras. 
It has a walking function that's random but tries to keep itself in the lower right and preferes to walk up and down since the farm area in kanto is around 3*15.
It's programmed to use sleep powder in the first move so that you can through at least 2 poke balls!
