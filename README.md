This is a tool built with python that locates on the screen occurrences of UI parts such as the health bar of the player and Metins. It's possible to use this in any server and you shouldn't get banned as long as you  don't leave it running 24/7. There's no code injection or memory fuzzing. It simply takes screenshots and based on the current state makes the decision to continue farming or to use skills and pots. There are some costum functions build for mass book reading and etc but this ones you'll have to manually put the items in a certain place of the screen (uses static positions)!
